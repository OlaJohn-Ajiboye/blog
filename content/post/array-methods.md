Hellooo!,

In this tutorial we'll be building a tiny web application using Vue.js with Vuex and  Firebase.The data table we'll be building will update the UI and the firestore database in real-time based on user interaction.I have decided to go with an example not more complex than a todo-list, but a little more interesting thana todo list.

What we'll be building is a simple data-table that tracks user interaction. Some of the assumptions I will make are that you have Node and NPM installed and a basic knowledge of Javascript.

## Project description

## Project SetUp
 First things first, let's install the Vue CLI. Pop open your command line/Powershell. It doesn't really matter what directory you are. This tutorial is based on Windows OS, you can easily find similar commands for other OS. Open the command line as an adminstrator and run ```npm install -g @vue/cli ``` .
 This will quickly install the Vue CLI globally. To verify if your installation worked correctly, check the version of Vue installed by running ``` vue --version```.
